"""Deterministic symbolic verification of a chain of student working.

This module is the only component permitted to assert mathematical truth.
It contains no LLM calls, no network access and no file I/O, which is what
makes it exhaustively testable.

Model: each written line is an equation and therefore denotes a solution set.
A legitimate algebraic step preserves that set. Comparing the solution set of
line n with line n-1 classifies what went wrong:

    shrank  -> a root was discarded (dividing by the unknown, dropping the +/-)
    grew    -> a spurious root appeared (e.g. squaring both sides)
    changed -> an algebra or arithmetic error

Two kinds of line are not solution sets to be compared, and treating them as
such invents errors that the student did not make: a line that could not be
parsed, and a line that is an identity (true for every value of the unknown).
Both are skipped, leaving the comparison to run between the lines either side.
One answer written over several lines ('x = 2' then 'x = 3') is likewise read
as a single logical step.
