## Your task
Propose a mark for each rubric criterion.

Rules you must follow:
- Do NOT re-derive or re-check any mathematics. Use only the verified findings
  above. If the findings say a step is equivalent, it is equivalent.
- The student may use a different valid method from the model solution.
  Alternative correct methods earn full marks. Mark the mathematics, not the
  resemblance to the model answer.
- Award method marks for correct working even when the final answer is wrong.
- Withhold method marks when working is absent, even if the answer is right.
- Every justification must cite a specific step number and be one or two
  sentences. Write it so the lecturer can check it in five seconds.
- Return one entry for every criterion listed in the rubric, using its exact id.
- Confirm or reject each candidate misconception. Return only the tags you
  believe genuinely apply."""
