"""Populate fixtures/llm_cache/ from real handwritten images.

The demo runs entirely offline (DEMO_MODE=offline) by serving cached model
responses -- see app/llm.py. Those responses have to come from somewhere: this
script walks fixtures/images/ for real photographs, sends each one through
app.transcriber.transcribe with a live API key, and lets app/llm.py's normal
content-addressed cache write the response to fixtures/llm_cache/ as a side
effect. Nothing here talks to the cache directly.

This does NOT call the marking or feedback stages -- those prompts depend on
the *confirmed* transcription (which a lecturer edits in the UI), so their
cache entries cannot be pre-warmed from a raw image the way transcription's
can. ``scripts/seed_demo_cache.py`` prepares all AI stages for every curated
case from ``fixtures/offline_demo_cases.json`` without an API key. This script
remains useful for collecting genuine live vision responses for new images.

Requires DEMO_MODE=live and a real ANTHROPIC_API_KEY. Deliberately exits early
and cleanly if either is missing, rather than letting app.llm raise partway
through a run.

Run:  .venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/warm_cache.py
